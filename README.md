California Housing Price Prediction
This project predicts housing prices in California using machine learning. It follows an end-to-end pipeline including data exploration, outlier treatment, feature scaling, multiple regression models, and final model comparison.
Data set
Source: California Housing Dataset (Scikit-Learn)
Features:
MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude
Target: Median House Price (price)
